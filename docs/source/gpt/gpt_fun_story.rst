2.1 Story Teller
==========================

This Python script integrates OpenAI's GPT with hardware components like a button and a camera to create an interactive storytelling experience based on a book cover photo. 

The program waits for the user to press a button.





When pressed:

#. A photo of the book cover is captured.

#. The photo is sent to OpenAI's GPT model, which generates a story summary.

#. The story is converted to speech and played back.


----------------------------------------------

**Features**

* Interactive Experience: Users can interact with the system through a button and receive both visual and auditory feedback.

* AI-Powered Storytelling: GPT interprets the book cover and provides a creative summary.

* Voice Feedback: The generated story is read aloud, enhancing accessibility and engagement.

**Code Explanation**

1. Import Necessary Libraries

.. code-block:: python

   import openai
   from keys import OPENAI_API_KEY
   import readline  # Optimize keyboard input
   import sys
   import os
   from pathlib import Path
   import subprocess
   from fusion_hat.pin import Pin
   from picamera2 import Picamera2

* ``openai``: To interact with OpenAI's GPT and Whisper models.
* ``fusion_hat``: To handle button presses for capturing photos.
* ``picamera2``: To control the Raspberry Pi camera for taking photos.
* ``subprocess``: To play audio files for text-to-speech output.


2. Initialize OpenAI Client and Hardware

.. code-block:: python

   client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

This sets up the OpenAI client with the provided API key for accessing GPT and Whisper models.

.. code-block:: python

   button = Pin(17, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_DOWN)
   camera = Picamera2()

The button connected to GPIO pin 17 triggers the photo capture process. The ``Picamera2`` instance controls the Raspberry Pi camera.


3. Capture Photo

.. code-block:: python

   def capture_photo():
      """
      Capture a photo using the Picamera2 and save it as 'my_photo.jpg'.
      """
      try:
         print(f'\033[1;30m{"Shooting photo..."}\033[0m')
         # Set preview configuration
         camera.configure(camera.preview_configuration)
         camera.start()
         camera.capture_file("my_photo.jpg")
         camera.stop()
      except Exception as e:
         print(f"Error capturing photo: {e}")

* Configures the camera's preview settings.
* Starts the camera to capture an image.
* Saves the image as `my_photo.jpg`.

4. Text-to-Speech Conversion

.. code-block:: python

   def text_to_speech(text):
      """
      Convert text to speech using OpenAI's TTS model.
      """
      speech_file_path = Path(__file__).parent / "speech.mp3"
      try:
         with client.audio.speech.with_streaming_response.create(
               model="tts-1", voice="alloy", input=text
         ) as response:
               response.stream_to_file(speech_file_path)
         subprocess.Popen("mplayer speech.mp3", shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT).wait()
      except Exception as e:
         print(f"Error in Text-to-Speech: {e}")

* Converts text responses from GPT into an audio file (``speech.mp3``) using OpenAI's text-to-speech model.
* Plays the audio file using the ``mplayer`` command.


5. Interact with GPT for Storytelling

The ``story_talking()`` function:

.. code-block:: python

   file = client.files.create(
      file=open("my_photo.jpg", "rb"), purpose="vision"
   )

Upload the Photo: The captured photo (``my_photo.jpg``) is uploaded to OpenAI for processing.


.. code-block:: python

   message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
      thread_id=thread.id,
      role="user",
      content=[
            {"type": "text", "text": "What is this book about?"},
            {"type": "image_file", "image_file": {"file_id": file.id}},
      ],
   )

Send a User Query: The script sends a message along with the photo to the assistant.

.. code-block:: python

   run = client.beta.threads.runs.create_and_poll(
      thread_id=thread.id, assistant_id=assistant.id
   )

   if run.status == "completed":
      messages = client.beta.threads.messages.list(thread_id=thread.id)
      for message in messages.data:
            if message.role == "assistant":
               for block in message.content:
                  if block.type == "text":
                        response = block.text.value
                        print(f"Assistant >>> {response}")
                        text_to_speech(response)
                        return

Process GPT Response: GPT processes the input and generates a response. The response includes a story summary, which is printed and converted to speech.

6. OpenAI Assistant Configuration

.. code-block:: python

   assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
      name="Storyteller Bot",
      instructions=(
         "You are a storyteller. When given a book cover image, "
         "provide a brief story summary as if you were telling a bedtime story."
      ),
      model="gpt-4o-mini",
   )

This defines the assistant's role and ensures that responses are formatted appropriately for storytelling.


7. Event Loop

.. code-block:: python

   try:
      while True:
         print(f'\033[1;30m{"Waiting for button press to capture photo..."}\033[0m')
         button.wait_for_press()
         capture_photo()
         story_talking()
   finally:
      # Clean up resources
      button.close()
      client.beta.assistants.delete(assistant.id)
      print("Resources cleaned up. Exiting.")

* Waits for a button press.
* Captures a photo when the button is pressed.
* Sends the photo to GPT for storytelling.
* Plays the generated story using text-to-speech.
* The finally block ensures proper cleanup.

**Debugging Tips**

1. Camera Issues: 
   
   * Ensure the Raspberry Pi camera is enabled and connected properly. Run raspi-config to check camera settings.

2. Incomplete Book Cover in Photo:
   
   * Since this project lacks a preview screen, ensure the book is positioned properly before pressing the button:
      
      * Place the book at a consistent distance and angle relative to the camera.
      * Use a fixed stand or guide to ensure the book's cover fits entirely within the camera's frame.
      * Test with different setups to determine the optimal placement for consistent results.
   
   * If cropping issues persist, consider using a connected display or external device to verify positioning during setup.
