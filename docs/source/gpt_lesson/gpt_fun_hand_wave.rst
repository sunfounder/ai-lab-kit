2.6 Hand-wave Interaction System
======================================

This project is a gesture interaction system that utilizes two infrared obstacle avoidance sensors to detect hand waves. The system sends detected sensor events to an OpenAI-powered assistant, which analyzes the time difference between sensor activations to determine the nature of the user's hand movement. Based on the analysis, the assistant generates relevant responses, such as recognizing a wave gesture and responding accordingly.


-----------------------------------

**Features**

- **Dual Infrared Sensor Input**: Detects hand motion using two sensors placed 10 cm apart.
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Determines the direction, speed, and type of hand waves.
- **AI-Based Interpretation**: Sends sensor trigger data to OpenAI for processing and response generation.
- **LED Indicator**: Signals system status during gesture recognition.
- **Event-Driven Execution**: Uses GPIO callbacks for efficient real-time detection.

**Code Explanation**

This project is divided into multiple key functional components:

1. **Initialization and Setup:**

   - Imports necessary modules, including ``openai`` for AI processing and ``fusion_hat`` for GPIO handling.
   - Initializes the OpenAI API client with ``OPENAI_API_KEY``.
   - Configures GPIO pins for the left and right sensors, as well as an LED indicator.

2. **Sensor Event Handling**:

   - Each time a sensor is triggered, the timestamp and sensor ID are recorded in ``events``.
   - If at least two events are detected, the system calls ``analyze_hand_wave`` to determine the gesture.

   .. code-block:: python

       def sensor_triggered(sensor_id):
           global events
           timestamp = time.time()
           events.append((sensor_id, timestamp))
           print(f"Sensor {sensor_id} triggered at {timestamp}")

           if len(events) >= 2:
               analyze_hand_wave()

3. **Hand Wave Analysis**:

   - Verifies that at least two sensor triggers exist.
   - Sends the recorded sensor event data to OpenAI for interpretation.
   - Receives and processes the AI response, which describes the gesture.

   .. code-block:: python

       def analyze_hand_wave():
           global events
           if len(events) < 2:
               return
           print("Start analyzing hand wave...")
           led.off()

           try:
               message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
                   thread_id=thread.id,
                   role="user",
                   content=str(events),
               )

               run = client.beta.threads.runs.create_and_poll(
                   thread_id=thread.id,
                   assistant_id=assistant.id,
               )

               if run.status == "completed":
                   messages = client.beta.threads.messages.list(thread_id=thread.id)
                   for message in messages.data:
                       if message.role == 'assistant':
                           for block in message.content:
                               if block.type == 'text':
                                   decoded_message = block.text.value
                           break
               print(f"Decoded Message: {decoded_message}")
               events.clear()
               led.on()
           except Exception as e:
               print(f"Error in AI processing: {e}")

4. **AI Integration and Response Processing:**

   - Uses OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to analyze hand motion patterns.
   - Determines wave characteristics, such as speed and direction.
   - Responds with an appropriate message based on movement patterns.

5. **System Loop and Cleanup:**

   - Uses ``pause()`` to keep the program running indefinitely.
   - On exit (e.g., via ``CTRL+C``), cleans up resources and deletes the OpenAI assistant instance.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           print("Press CTRL+C to exit.")
           pause()
       finally:
           print("Resources cleaned up. Exiting.")
           client.beta.assistants.delete(assistant.id)

**Debugging Tips**

- **No sensor triggers detected?**

  - Ensure the infrared sensors are correctly wired and powered.
  - Print raw sensor readings to verify their functionality.

- **AI not responding?**

  - Confirm your OpenAI API key is valid and properly set.
  - Check network connectivity to ensure API calls are successful.

- **Incorrect gesture interpretation?**

  - Verify that sensor timestamps are correctly recorded.
  - Increase the distance between sensors if wave detection is too sensitive.

- **LED not turning on/off?**

  - Confirm the GPIO pin assignments match the hardware setup.
  - Ensure the ``led.on()`` and ``led.off()`` functions are correctly called.
